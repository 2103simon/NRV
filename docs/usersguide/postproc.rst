Post-processing
===============

Post-processing function, both at the cellular or fascicle (nerve) levels have been implemented in NRV. The code is mainly consisting in function, opposed to method. This is due to the nature of results, returned by the ``simulate`` method that consist in a python dictionary and not  a specific object.

This chapter contains:

* a more in depth explanation of the results' dictionary returned by simulate methods
* explanation of axon/cellular level post-processing functions
* explanation of fascicle (nerve) level post-processing functions
