NRV is designed using Oriented-Oriented principles for two reasons:
- first, the description of simulation context and scenario implies the coordination of several physical objects (physiological such as fibers, fascicles, or technological such as electrodes for instance). Using a parallel to coding paradigm is a relatively natural way of easing the scripting.
- Python is by nature object oriented, and actions such as simulation, condifugration are naturally described and attached to main object.

As the description of new object can be quite confusing for end-user, NRV is build with two way of object instanciation described here further.
